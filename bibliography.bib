The data is made available under the Freedomof Information Law and provides information pickup, drop off, and payments made in New York City medallion taxis. The goal of the DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge is to process the spatio-temporal data streams and calculate real- time indicators of most frequent routes and most profitable areas in the New York City.},
