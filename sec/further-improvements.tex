\section{Further Improvements}
\label{sec:further-improvements}

Store the fields of tuples not directly involved in the ranking calculation, and retrieve them only when necessary in the output of a new ranking.

Increase the parallelization degree of the operations within the same operator.

Minimize the back-pressure induced by the feedback stream, by dynamic buffer sizes according to a EWMA-like discipline.

Refine the ranking operator's filter, so that it can ignore the tuples that may not induce a ranking update.

Explore new heuristic approaches to the problem of determining the maximum size of a clique.

Increase the throughput of the graph management through the use of bulk operations (Redis is bad for many little operations \cite{Zhang2014}).

Evaluate the performance of our solution in a distributed system.
